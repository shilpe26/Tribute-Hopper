In 1944, she was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer and <mark>invented the first compiler</mark> for a computer programming language. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of <mark>COBOL</mark>, one of the first high-level programming languages.</blockquote>
